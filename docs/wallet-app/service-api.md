Service APIs are a set of backend APIs that are organized in terms of high-level wallet functionalities. They are defined in the webapp layer, and the frontend uses these APIs to communicate with the backend. The service APIs are RESTful APIs that are divided into user, account, CICO, and admin. 

### User

User APIs handle user creation, and information management and updates.
